# Steps to follow#

* Copy the code created in step 5 to step6 directory

* In index.html, we have added a new page to submit stories. This uses jQueryMobile form styling.

* In app.js, we are now binding to tap events. We binded tap events for navbar as well as stories.

* Install a Cordova plugin to open the story InAppBrowser rather than default browser.
```
$ cordova plugin add org.apache.cordova.inappbrowser
```

* Install the application on device
```
$ cordova run android
```
